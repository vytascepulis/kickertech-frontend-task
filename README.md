# Frontend task for Kickertech

To spin this up locally: clone repo -> npm run dev. Alternatively to test prod build: change `VITE_DEV_ENDPOINT_URL` to `/api` -> npm run build -> npm run express:prod

For data persistance decided to create a mock db as a json file with express handling endpoints, all real validation would happen on backend
